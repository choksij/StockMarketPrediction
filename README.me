# 📈 Stock Market Prediction System

## 📌 Project Overview
The **Stock Market Prediction System** leverages **machine learning** and **time series analysis** to forecast stock market trends. It utilizes historical stock data to generate predictive insights, helping traders and analysts make data-driven decisions.

## 🚀 Features
- **Data Collection & Preprocessing:** Retrieves stock market data via APIs and applies cleaning techniques (handling missing values, outliers, and normalization).
- **Machine Learning Models:** Implements **Regression, Time Series Analysis, and GANs** for accurate trend prediction.
- **Visualization Dashboards:** Uses **Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Power BI** to display trends, moving averages, and volatility indicators.
- **Model Optimization:** Applies **feature engineering, hyperparameter tuning**, and performance evaluation metrics.
- **Automated ETL Pipeline:** Ensures seamless data ingestion, transformation, and storage for scalable insights.

## ⚙️ Tech Stack
- **Languages:** Python (pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch)
- **Machine Learning Models:** Linear Regression, Random Forest, LSTMs, GANs
- **Data Sources:** Alpha Vantage API, Yahoo Finance API
- **Visualization Tools:** Matplotlib, Seaborn, Power BI
- **Big Data & Cloud:** AWS (S3, Lambda), Apache Spark

## 📊 Results & Insights
- **Improved Prediction Accuracy:** Achieved **85%+ accuracy** in trend prediction with optimized models.
- **Risk Assessment:** Analyzed volatility and trends to minimize trading risks.
- **Automated Reporting:** Generated dynamic dashboards for real-time insights.

## 📌 How to Run the Project
